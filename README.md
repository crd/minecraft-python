This is intended to be collection of resources that will be useful for anyone getting started executing python scripts against a minecraft server.

## BuildPlatform

This is a proof of concept python script that should (hopefully) work against minecraft-pi (aka a Raspberry Pi minecraft installation) as well as a Spigot server running the RaspberryJuice mod.
